# LoanDataPortfolio

The goal of this project is to help the sales team understand the members in the loan portfolio based on application data source.
Warehouse. I analyzed the data in “LoanData.csv” and provided three insights about the membership
and two recommendations on opportunities for the sales team. The conclusion is supported by written reasoning as well as charts and visuals. For visuals, I used Microsoft Power BI Desktop.
